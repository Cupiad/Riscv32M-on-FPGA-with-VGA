# Riscv32M-on-FPGA-with-VGA

This is my Seminar Project. It is a RiscV32 processor that i got provided by the Institute for complex systems from the JKU.
The processor got expanded to support the M extension. It also uses VGA to show its Registers, Pc counter and Intructions on a Monitor.
For the generation of text i use the library from [Derek-X-Wang](https://github.com/Derek-X-Wang/VGA-Text-Generator).
